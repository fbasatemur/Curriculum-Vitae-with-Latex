\cvsection{projects}
\cvevent{}{Image Quality Assessment with Artificial Neural Network}{} {}

Artificial neural network that can measure clarity from tissue images produced using light microscope was created. The artificial neural network stages in the project are parallel with CUDA and the other stages are coded using C / C ++.

\divider

\smallskip


\begin{adjustwidth}{}{-8.3cm}

\cvevent{}{Artificial Neural Network Design using CUDA}{}{}
It offers parallel testing of artificial neural network models created using Keras in C ++ environment with CUDA. Dense, BatchNormalization, ReLU, Sigmoid etc. layers are programmed with CUDA.

\divider

\cvevent{}{NSST Optimum Focused Image Generate}{}{}
Non-Subsampled Shearlet Transform (NSST) is the newest image processing algorithm for the restoration of any image and proposed by Gitta Kutyniok, Wang-Q Lim, Xiaosheng Zhuang. It is used as a process step to obtain a clear image from blurry images in a data set. Project is aimed to obtain the clearest image from the images in a dataset and it was coded with C ++.

\divider

\cvevent{}{SRCNN Image Restoration}{}{}
Single image super resolution example has been tried to be created with Python/Keras and PyQt5. SRCNN artificial neural network model was used for image clarification.

\divider

\cvevent{}{Multilayer \& Multicategory Learning Rules ANN Design}{}{}
A multi-layer and multi-neuron artificial neural network was designed. Classification of linear or nonlinear 2 dimensional samples was carried out. The project was implemented with Visual C ++ CLI.

\divider

\cvevent{}{Medical Mask Detection}{}{}
Covid-19 medical mask detection for public places
\begin{itemize}
    \item Artificial neural network created and trained using Python and Keras.
\end{itemize}

\divider

\cvevent{}{Classificaton of Skin Cancer with CNN}{}{}
Classification of 7 different cancer groups using Skin Cancer MNIST HAM 10000 dataset
\begin{itemize}
    \item Artificial neural network created and trained using Python and Keras.
    \item Visualized with PyQt5
\end{itemize}

\divider

\cvevent{}{Circle and Line Detection with Hough Transform}{}{}
Hough Space algorithm is used to determine the line / circle on the image by performing the edge detection in the Canny Edge Detection process on the image.


\divider

\cvevent{}{Unsupervised Learning Classification}{}{}
It is the determination of each object using the K-Means algorithm on the image and the object detection as a result of the feature extraction of each object.


\divider

\cvevent{}{ChatONE Chatapp}{}{}
A messaging application was created in the PyQt5 interface with socket programming and multithreading.

\divider

\cvevent{}{Commercial Automation}{}{}
Commercial automation application has been implemented.
C \# / DevExpress Framework and MsSQL used while creating.

\divider

\cvevent{}{Site of University Graduates}{}{}
A website with PHP, MySQL and JS has been designed for university graduates.
